Desktop hamster

Detects if you have been slacking: scrolling social media, playing roblox, or idling
Algorithm:
- Detects 4 reels scrolled
- Based on our scrolling data of time spent per reel, it listens to the periods of clicking or scrolling, which means the user is scrolling
- And the user's active window is a "slacking window"

Hamster actions to get you to lock in:
- Drag mouse away when you're slacking
- Slap mouse away when you're slacking
- Makes the window size smaller when you're slacking
- BITES the video playing when you're slacking
- SPLATS onto your screen when you're daydreaming

Getting too annoying or taking a break?
- Long click on Nibbles to put him to sleep and long click to wake him

## Inspiration
We love hamsters. Hamsters are everywhere in our feed. And guess what, according to two of our teammates, one of us looks, acts and behaves like a hamster? Plus, we are all social media addicts and need someone to make us **LOCK IN**!!!

## Challenges Faced
We're a team with low hackathon experience, and PyQt5 is a completely new library to us and not a particularly easy one to learn. With zero experience building these kinds of projects, it was difficult for us to get started
As STEM people, we were unsure if our sprites will turn out nice 😭.

## Accomplishments we are proud of
We quickly learnt and coded with Codex and Chatgpt, basically learning how to do this entire thing on the fly. Cute drawings 🤩

## What we learned
We have learned more about using Python for GUI and also how to utilise AI Agents to maximise our productivity!

## What's next for Nibbles
In the future, we hope to enable more customisations for users, e.g. customising name and colour. We also plan to allow users to exchange their lock-in time for food to feed their hamster.



## Debug
If there's a PyQt5 error, try reinstalling with
`python -m pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall PyQt5 PyQt5-sip`
